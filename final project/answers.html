    <h3 id="common">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
    <h1 id="question">What happens to my child if I get deported?</h1>
    <p id="answer">A relative will be in the care of the child if not friends that might be able to take care of them.</p>

    <h1 id="question">Who is eligible for asylum?</h1>
    <p id="answer">An asylum application must demonstrate two things to satisfy this requirement: The applicant must show that the reason the persecution that is being done is because of being in one of the five protected grounds (race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a social group).</p>

    <h1 id="question">What is a green card?</h1>
    <p id="answer">A “green card,” issued by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), provides proof of lawful permanent resident status, with authorization to live and work anywhere in the United States. Most green cards must be renewed every ten years, but some conditional green cards based on marriage or investment must be made permanent after the first two years.</p>

    <h1 id="question">Why would a green card application be denied?</h1>
    <p id="answer">A green card application may be denied by the government for several reasons, including but not limited to mistakes on the required forms, missing documents, insufficient financial resources, or failure to demonstrate eligibility.</p>

    <h1 id="question">What is the difference between a fiancé visa and a marriage visa?</h1>
    <p id="answer">A K-1 or “fiancé visa” is a temporary visa available only to fiancés of U.S. citizens who are living outside of the United States and intend to get married within 90 days of arriving in the United States. A marriage green card is available to spouses of both U.S. citizens and U.S. green card holders, whether living in the United States or abroad, and ultimately provides permanent residency.</p>
