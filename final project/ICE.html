      <h3>What to do if immigration agents want to enter</h3>

      <p>
        If the agents want to enter, ask them if they have a warrant signed by a judge. If ICE agents do not have a warrant signed by  a Judge, you may refuse to open the door or let them in. An administrative warrant of removal from immigration authorities is not enough.
        If they say they have a warrant, ask them to slip the warrant under the door.
      </p>

      <h3>  Asking for a warrant</h3>
      <p>
        Look at the top and at the signature line to see if it was issued by a court and signed by a judge. Only a court/judge warrant is enough for entry into your premises. One issued by DHS or ICE and signed by a DHS or ICE employee is not.
        Do not open your door unless ICE shows you a judicial search or arrest warrant naming a person in your residence and/or areas to be searched at your address.
        In all other cases, keep the door closed. State: “I do not consent to your entry.”
